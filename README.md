## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vladc99/Askuity
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Askuity
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run wdio
```

This command will start the WebdriverIO test runner, which will execute the spec files located in the `src/specs` directory.

## Notes

With more time I would've added a few more features

1.  Screenshots
2.  Allure Report
3.  Enviroment file
4.  Better log reporting
